# Testing Dynamic-Compute

`Dynamic Compute` is now a public Descartes Labs client and can be tested internally within the organization. To set up a testing environment you can follow these general steps:

1. Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Create a [new environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) >= Python 3.8
3. Install the Dynamic Compute library via `pip install 'git+https://github.com/descarteslabs/descarteslabs-dynamic-compute'`.
   - If you have previously installed the client and would like the latest client, run `pip uninstall dynamic-compute` prior to installing.
4. Clone the public repo into a local directory to access the example notebooks `git clone https://github.com/descarteslabs/descarteslabs-dynamic-compute.git`
